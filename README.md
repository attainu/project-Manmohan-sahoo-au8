Junk File Organizer Project:
  The aim of this project is to build a python program that runs as a command-line tool. Basically, as a lazy programmer, my desktop is full of files as shown below. Due to a large number of files, it is a daunting task to sit and organize each file. To make that task easy,  the Python script that comes in handy and returns some folders where all the files are organized in a well-manner within seconds. It should organize by size, last used or even extensions. 

How To Use:
  • To Organize with extension:
    type the below code in terminal:
      python (python filename) --path (your folder path) --o extension
      eg= python project.py --path E:\folder --o extension
  • To Organize with size:
    type the below code in terminal:
      python (python filename) --path (your folder path) --o size
      eg= python project.py --path E:\folder --o size
